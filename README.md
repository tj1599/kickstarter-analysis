#An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
I recommend Louise to reanalyze her budget and see if she can cut down any of the costs to make it a bit more realistic.


# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to help Loise to analyze the data she had provided and to figure out whether or not her goals were possible given historical data. We were tasked with forming descriptive statistics, pivot tables, and various visual aids in order to help the end user come to a decision.
### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges
I performed analysis in a variety of ways, one of which includes the use of conditional formatting. I used this tool to make the data easier to decipher at a quick glance by applying a color to each outcome as shown in the attachd link.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92830382/138385253-8cb0cd79-c859-4488-b7b0-c051be3494db.png) One challenge that i faced was figuring out how to use the COUNTIFS formula correctly, however i used Google Fu to find tutotials on this formula which helped tremendously.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I was able to create a pivot table to chart out the amount of successful, failed, and canceled theater startups there were by month and year. This would aid Louise in making a decision as to when she should launch her own startup. Given this data we can conclude that the best month to launch a theater kickstarter is May, as we notice the number of successful outcomes is 111. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For this section of analysis, I was able to write a series of COUNTIFS formulas to pull the number of Successful, Failed, and Canceled outcomes pased on a variety of Goal ranges for the subategory Plays. After calculating the percentages and charting the figures using a line graph, we are able to deduce that the amount of successful plays is much higher in the 0-4,999 as well as in the 35,000-39,999 range. However, we see huge dips in success rate when the goal is 25,000-29,999 as well as anything greater than 45,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
I believe a limitation in this dataset is a column breaking down the goal of each kickstarter.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Another graph that we could create is the average amount pledged by month for plays. This would help Louise decide if tax season is better to launch her kickstarter than Christmas time.
